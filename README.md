# Sales Data Analysis Using Python 

This project demonstrates a simple sales data analysis using **SQLite3** and **Python**. It creates a local SQLite database, inserts product-level sales data, and performs basic analysis using SQL queries within Python.

---

## 📦 Features

- Creates a local SQLite database (`sales_data.db`)
- Populates it with mock sales data (product, quantity, and price)
- Performs basic SQL queries for analysis:
  - Total sales value per product
  - Top-selling products by quantity
  - Revenue generation by product
  - Overall revenue insights

---
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional, depending on visualizations)
- sklearn (if modeling was involved)

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, data types, and inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics to understand variable distributions.
- **Data Visualization**: Used various plots (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) to visualize relationships and trends.
- **Insights & Interpretations**: Extracted actionable or interesting findings from the dataset.

## 🧪 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (comes pre-installed with Python)

Install dependencies (if any):
```bash
pip install pandas
