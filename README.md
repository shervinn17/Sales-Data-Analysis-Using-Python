# Elevate Labs - Task 7

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the analysis and results for Task 7 assigned by Elevate Labs. The primary objective of this task was to perform data exploration, uncover key insights, and present a clear understanding of the dataset through visualizations and analytical techniques.

## 📂 Contents

- `Elevate Labs Task 7.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- `README.md` - Project documentation (you’re here!).

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this task was to:
- Load and preprocess the given dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate key insights using statistical summaries and visualizations
- Optionally apply clustering or modeling techniques (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional, depending on visualizations)
- sklearn (if modeling was involved)

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, data types, and inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics to understand variable distributions.
- **Data Visualization**: Used various plots (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) to visualize relationships and trends.
- **Insights & Interpretations**: Extracted actionable or interesting findings from the dataset.

## 📊 Visual Highlights

*(You can embed saved figures or screenshots if this will be used on GitHub or in a report.)*

## 📈 Potential Next Steps

- Apply advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., clustering or prediction).
- Create an interactive dashboard.
- Conduct deeper feature engineering or time series analysis (if relevant).

## 🧾 Requirements

Make sure to install the required packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
